# E-commerce Website Architecture

There are two essential things to keep in mind:

A good e-commerce site architecture serves both humans and machines (sounds technical, but we will describe it in a more detailed and understandable way below).

A good site structure makes browsing intuitive. It thinks for users and predicts their further actions.

A poor e-commerce platform architecture is not intuitive. This makes it difficult for people to use your website and impossible for search engines to understand it.

On the other hand, a good site structure makes finding information simple and intuitive and thus does not require too much thought from users. Such content is also available for indexing by search engines, which deliver the content to users.

The picture above shows two e-commerce architecture diagrams. One represents a good site architecture that organizes pages into ordered structures. The second illustrates a poor site architecture consisting of disorganized, disparate pages.

Building the website structure is an indispensable step in the internal technical optimization of a website. The site structure affects:

The behavioral factor of SEO. The convenience and understandability of the site’s structure for users are indicated by their behavior on the site and the bounce rate.
Conversion. Site structure is directly related to the site’s usability, which plays a nearly decisive role in e-commerce purchasing.
Transfer of reference weight. Good site structure will help correctly distribute the link weight by priority.
Indexing speed. A transparent, straightforward site structure simplifies the route for search robots and contributes to faster and more extensive site indexing.
Site links. Proper site structure affects how your site’s additional internal links appear in search results.
